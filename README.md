Find the nth-permutation of a string when ordered alphabetically

I got bored, so I made a program to solve a math problem from a Number theory class. It finds the nth-permutation of a string, when the list of all permutations of said string is ordered alphabetically. This does not yet allow for the factoring of duplicates, so it cannot differentiate between the two permutations of 'hello', hlleo, and hlleo. I might add it as an option if I feel like it later.
